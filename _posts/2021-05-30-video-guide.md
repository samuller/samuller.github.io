Here's my guide of amateur advice after recently recording videos of some sports matches:

1. Take your phone and record a video until your arm gets tired
   - For less shaky video buy a tripod with a phone holder
2. Record at lower quality to save storage space
   - Quality is easier to select when recording with the [Open Camera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera) or [Camera MX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx) apps on Android
   - Or, rather get and use an SD card
     - [SDXC or SDUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#Comparison) use ExFAT which is required for large files (> 4Gb)
     - [Speed class](https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/speed-class/) also matters for HD+ video
3. Remember to fully charge your phone before recording
   - A powerbank/battery pack helps a lot
4. Copy the video to your PC via USB or Wifi
   - Use the [Asus File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asus.filemanager) app on Android to copy files over Wifi
5. Edit videos with [OpenShot Video Editor](https://www.openshot.org/)
   - You can cut, paste & easily edit videos into sections
   - Add various transitions & effects and customise properties (e.g. scaling/zoom, rotation, shear, playback speed, volume)
   - Create intro & outro "titles" and use "tracks" to overlay titles or new audio (or other video) over original video
   - When exporting video, set "Quality" setting manually (under Advanced -> Video Settings -> Bit Rate/Quality) to match that of your original video (viewable in VLC -> Media/Codec information -> Statistics)
6. Upload to Youtube
